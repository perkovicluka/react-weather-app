## react-weather-app

[Demo](https://perkovicluka.github.io/react-weather-app/)

This project is for my final performance task for my ICS4U Grade 12 class.

This project is a weather web app. The app includes an input field for entering a city name and shows current weather data (temp, humidity, wind speed, etc.) with corresponding images/pictures/backgrounds to emphasize the data (Ex. If it is raining outside the background will turn rainy and the weather symbol will turn into a rain cloud). The api used is from [https://openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/)
